# Gender and Age Detection using DenseNet, MobileNet, and Inception Models

## Problem Statement
Gender and age detection from images is a fundamental task in computer vision with various real-world applications such as targeted advertising, audience analysis, and security systems. This project aims to develop and compare deep learning models based on DenseNet, MobileNet, and Inception architectures for accurate gender and age detection from images.

## Explanation
This repository contains the implementation of gender and age detection using three different deep learning architectures: DenseNet, MobileNet, and Inception. Each model is trained and evaluated on a dataset consisting of facial images labeled with gender and age information. The models are trained to classify each image into one of the predefined gender and age categories.

The project involves the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: The facial images are preprocessed to ensure consistency and suitability for model training.
2. Model Training: DenseNet, MobileNet, and Inception models are trained using the preprocessed dataset.
3. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess their performance.
